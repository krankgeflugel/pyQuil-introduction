# pyQuil-introduction

An introduction to pyQuil.

Quil is a quantum instruction language developed by Rigetti. It is a low-level programming language for quantum computers,
where users specify the sequence of basic quantum gates that compose a quantum circuit. Pretty much like Assembly, for classical computers.

PyQuil is a Python library that can be used to construc quantum programs, and it is build on top of Quil. 

Before continuing, a user needs to install pyQuil. This is pretty simple and can be done following the instructions at
http://grove-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

Have fun learning quantum software engineering! :D
